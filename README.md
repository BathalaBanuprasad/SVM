# SVM

This is the implementation of Support Vector Machine, a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm. 
Details of implementation and theory of SVM canbe found [here](https://github.com/BathalaBanuprasad/SVM/blob/master/SVM%20Question.pdf). A Brief Report of findings, derivations and observations can be found [here](https://github.com/BathalaBanuprasad/SVM/blob/master/SVM%20Report.pdf).

Below is the sample generated data and its classifier generated by SVM algorithm ![sample svm classifier](https://github.com/BathalaBanuprasad/SVM/blob/master/svm_data2.png).
